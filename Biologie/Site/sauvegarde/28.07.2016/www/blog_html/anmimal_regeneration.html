    <h2> Animals regeneration</h2>

    <p>Every animals are able to regenerate, but on different levels. If you get a little injury, you would expect your body to repair it in a few time : that’s regeneration. But if you get your arm cut of, for example, you wouldn’t expect a new one to grow, so the human regeneration have limits. That’s different for others animals like the planeria or the salamander who have incredible regeneration skills.</p>
    <p><strong>Problem: In what extant animals are able to regenerate themselves ?</strong/></p>
    
    <h3>Summary</h3>
    

    <p> After an <a href="#amputation">amuputation</a>, through a process still to be elucidated but involving infiltrated macrophages, stem cells are attracted to the site of the injury. They form stem-cell <a href="#blastema">cluster</a> which, through <a href="#regeneration_control">control by locally generated hormones</a>, will differentiate into the different missing organs</p>

    <h3>Generation of body parts in planarian flatworms</h3>
    

    <p>Planarains are invertebrate flatworms that have the unbelievable ability to regenerate any part of their body. The most extraordinary example is the full regeneration of head structures after decapitation of the animal. More surprisingly, as a cherry on the pudding, the animal also regains its memory.</p>

    <h4 id="blastema">Blastema</h4>
    <p>The accumulation of stem cells on the site of the injury form what we call a blastema. It is the cluster from where the missing part will be regenerated.</p>

	</figure>
    <p>Stem cells receive different kind of signals, provided by hormones, which instruct them the when and where of proliferation, differentiation and what cell type to adopt (turning into muscle, vasculature, nerve, epithelium, connective tissue, or other). There are many different hormones such as serotonin and dopamine, some of them are produced by muscle cells.<p>

    <h3>Regeneration of body parts in salamenders</h3>
    

    <p> After an injury (partial or total loss of body structures) different process repair the injured zone, partially or totally.</p>
    <p> Firstly, there is the inflammatory response where blood vessels expand, allowing more blood to enter the injured zone. This in turn leads to an enhanced presence of white blood cells, neutrophils and lymphocytes, that enter the tissue and initiate the process of immune defence and tissue repair (figure 1). The ensuing inflammation is also responsable for the pain sensation, because macrophages produce chemical messengers that stimulate nociceptive nerves.</p>

    	<figcaption></figcaption>
	</figure>
    <p>Both innate and adapted immunity leads to elimination of micro-organism that have entered the wound.</p>
    <p>Secondly, the injury also causes the recruitment of Stem Cells, who are essential for the regeneration of the tissues.</p>
    <p>The mechanism responsible of Stem cell’s recruitment, globally referred to as the “injury signal” isn’t known yet, but may cytokines produced by the macrophages may play an important role (acting as chemo-attractants). Indeed, a studies performed by the Australian Regenerative Medecine institute on salamanders, animals known for their capacity to regenerate entire anatomical structures, show that the macrophages play a role in the regeneration.</p>
    <p>Salamanders with macrophages normally regenerate a new member in about one year. Those that fail to recruit macrophages into the injured zone take much more longer to fully recover the lost body part. Salamanders totally lacking macrophages do not regenerate at all; these animals just manage to heal the wound by covering the body part with scar tissue.</p>
