    <h2> Stem cells definition</h2>

    <h3>Summary</h3>
    
    <p> Stem cells are able to replicate themselves into <a href="#before_replication">identical cells</a>, but they also can <a href="#before_replication">differentiate </a> into one or several  tissues according to their types and the environment. Indeed the diffrence between stem cells and differentiated ones is the ability of division.</p>
    <h3> Different types </h3>


    <h3> Self renewal </h3>
    <h4>Telomerase</h3>
    
    <p>Actually at each division, there is a lose of a small part at the end of the chromosome, it is called the <a href="before_replication">telomere </a>. And stem cells replicates many times in their all life, indeed they need an enzyme that rebulid this telomere, this one is named telomerase.</p>
    
    <h5 id="before_replication">Before replication</h4>
    <p>On this picture, both situation are representedÂ : when there is effective telomerase and telomere is rebuilt on the left and when there isn't telomerase and in this case chromosome is shorter.<p>

    <h5 id="positioning_telomerase">Positioning of telomerase</h4>
    <p>Before intervention of telomerase the chromosome of the daughter cell is shorter than the mother's one. Then the telomerase comes with its strand of RNA.</p>

    <h5 id="DNA_polymerase">DNA polymerase</h4>
      <p>Then de DNA polymerase complete the chromosome strand with complementary nucleotides with the telomere RNA strand.<p>

    <h4 href="niches"> Niches </h4>
A niche is a local tissue, a kind of microenvironments, where stem cells are maintained and fed but also regulated and, when needed, differentiated.

	<h5> Stem cells maintain </h3>
<p>In the basis of the intestinal gland, there is expression of Wnt in order to make proliferate multipotent stem cells and diffrenciation. But BMP-4 is also expressed, in order to regulate the differenciation because cells there are not  supposed to differentiate  to much.<p>
    <figure>
    	<img src="images/niches2.png" alt=""/>
    	<figcaption></figcaption>
    </figure>
	<h5>Differentiation </h5>
<p> The low expression of WNT in the middle and high region allow NOTCH to differentiate stem cells into differentiated cells.</p>
    <h3>Differentiation</h3>
<strong>what is a stemm cell ?</strong>
<p>stem cells are undiferenciated cells, able to replicate and renew indefinetly, and to differenciate into a specialised cell .
Generaly, the mitosis of a stem cell create one other stem cell and one progenetive cell who's going to differenciate into a specialised cell. So the stem cell's number remain constant <p>

    	<figcaption></figcaption>
    </figure>
<p>stem cells have been identified in many organes and tissues, in a specific area of each one : the stem cell niche .Stem cell's ability to replicate is verry limited outside the niche, so the niche environnement alowed stem cell to replicate .
In normal time, stem cells doesn't replicate much, just enough in order to keep the cell's population constant. But, after an injury, stem cells are activated (by the unknow "injury signal") and start replicate verry fast, in order to provide enough cells to fix the injury. that's why stem cell's are verry important for regeneration.</p>
